<h1>IoT watering - project documentation</h1>

<p>
This project implements a remote-controlled distributed watering system,
which:
<ol>
<li>waters plants periodically and automatically</li>
<li>collects data from the environment: moisture, humidity and
temperature</li>
<li>sends a daily report about the overall status</li>
<li>lets users access data at any time</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The acquisition of environmental information may let users carry on post
analysis.
For instance, identifying the best location to place succulent plants to 
have a dry soil.
</p>

<p>
The wireless power supplier is mainly used to simplify synchronization 
among components and reduce maintenance (due to battery
replacement).<br/>
This non-conventional use of this technology has been investigated to
provide additional user cases instead of the classical charging station.
</p>

<p>
The overall system includes a data collector (which leads operations and
aggregates all data) and a set of distributed units (see Figure 1).<br/>
Here after, they are named <b>supervisor</b> and <b>watering units</b>,
respectively.<br/>
The wireless power supplier is controlled by the supervisor to activate
the watering units when needed.<br/>
Moreover, the supervisor sends data to the cloud to store all the sampled
information (making it available to the users at any time).
</p>

<p>
Supervisor and watering units talk each other through a wireless
connection using ssWi as protocol.<br/>
This was developed for a previous project so it was already available and
tested.<br/>
This has been the motivation for other design choices, described later,
to reduce the overall cost of this project.
</p>

<p>
This section starts explaining the two main components: supervisor and
watering units.<br/>
Then, the scripts on the clouds, the communication protocol and user
interface are introduced.
</p>

<p>
Due to space reasons, the source code has not been copied here but it
is fully available online at this <a href="https://github.com/mbambagini/IoT_watering">repository</a> (tag: <i>release 1.0</i>). Looking at the tag date, you can check that the code was submitted by the 28th February.
</p>


<h2>Supervisor</h2>

<p>
The supervisor, shown in Figure 2, is composed of the following
components:
<ul>
<li>a mbed board: this leads the watering and data acquisition
    process</li>
<li>a PC: this collects data periodically from the mbed board, updates
    an internal database and sends data to the cloud</li>
</ul>
The PC and the mbed board are connected using a USB cable and
communicates using the mass memory available on the latter.<br/>
Note that, a Raspberry board would be able to do everything while 
requiring less space.
However, the mentioned hardware was already available without need to
buy anything else.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="supervisor.png" alt="Supervisor architecture"  width="600"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 2 - Supervisor architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let us start from the mbed board. It is in charge on periodically waking
up the watering units, leading the sampling step and, eventually, 
making them water the flowers.<br/>
This task is executed every interval <i>Tsamp</i> whose duration (in
minutes) can be configured by the user.<br/>
The main components are the following:
<ul>
<li>board</li>
<ul>
<li>mbed NXP LPC1768 - ARM Cortex M-3 MCU</li>
<li>powered by USB from the PC</li>
</ul>
<li>wireless power supplier</li>
<ul>
<li>enabled by digital out on pin 17</li>
<li>this module is powered by an additional USB link to the PC</li>
</ul>
<li>transceiver</li>
<ul>
<li>Xbee 802.15.4 using ssWi protocol</li>
</ul>
</ul>
The circuit of the board is reported in Figure 3.<br/>
As already said, this board is powered by USB (plugged directly to the
board) and the additional power is provided by another USB port.<br/>
<figure>
  <img src="supervisor_circuit.png" alt="Supervisor circuit"  width="600"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 3 - Supervisor circuit</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
The (single-thread) software running on the board performes the following
steps:
<ol>
<li>read from file the system configuration</li>
<ul>
<li>execution interval <i>Tsamp</i> (in minutes)</li>
<li>number of watering units</li>
<li>for each watering unit:</li>
<ul>
<li>network identifier</li>
<li>watering period <i>Twater</i> (number of <i>Tsamp</i> between two
    consecutive waterings)</li>
<li>watering duration</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>start network</i>
<li>while true</i>
<ol>
<li>wait <i>Tsamp</i> (in minutes)</i>
<li>lock busy file (the PC cannot access memory on the board)</li>
<li>read counter from file</li>
<li>power on the watering units</li>
<li>wait 20 seconds</li>
<li>sampling...</li>
<ul>
<li>send START_SAMPLING command</li>
<li>wait 60 seconds</li>
<li>send STOP_SAMPLING command</li>
<li>wait 2 seconds</li>
<li>for each watering unit</li>
<ul>
<li>read feedback</li>
<li>if feedback is OK, read temperature, humidity and moisture</li>
<li>store data to file</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>watering...</li>
<ul>
<li>for each watering unit <i>i</i></li>
<ul>
<li>if the number of interval since last watering is lower than
    configured, skip this node</li>
<li>send <i>Twater</i> of the <i>i</i>-th unit</li>
<li>wait 5 seconds</li>
<li>send the watering command for the <i>i</i>-th unit</li>
<li>wait <i>Twater</i> plus 5 more seconds</li>
<li>read feedback</li>
<li>store data to file
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>increase counter</li>
<li>serialize counter</li>
<li>send SHUTDOWN command</li>
<li>wait 5 seconds</li>
<li>power off the watering units</li>
<li>release busy file (now the PC can read the files)</li>
</ol>
</ol>
The file containing the sensor values has a line for each sample.<br/>
A line contains the internal counter value, the watering unit network
ID, the correctness of the value (1 if data is correct, 0 means that an 
error happened during the communication), temperature, humidity and
moisture.<br/>
A line-based structure is also used for the watering file.<br/>
An entry contains the counter value, the watering unit network ID, the 
result of the operation (1 all correct, 0 for errors) and the watering
seconds.<br/>
Data within files is separated by a single space (no special characters).
</p>

<p>
The software is available in the <i>supervisor</i> folder and it
depends on mbed drivers, mbed RTOS and the ssWi library for
the communication protocol.<br/>
</p>

<p>
The software running on the PC is a script (<i>update.sh</i>) that every
day collects the acquired data from the board and process this
information.<br/>
The script running on the PC executes the following steps:
<ul>
<li>while true</li>
<ol>
<li>wait 1 day</li>
<li>wait until the board is not busy</li>
<li>wait 5 seconds</li>
<li>copy the sensor and watering files locally</li>
<li>remove the counter file</li>
<li>process data...</li>
<ul>
<li>for each line in the sensor file</li>
<ol>
<li>parse data</li>
<li>convert relative time to absolute</li>
<li>save data in the database</li>
<li>send data to the cloud</li>
</ol>
<li>for each line in the watering file</li>
<ol>
<li>parse data</li>
<li>convert relative time to absolute</li>
<li>save data in the database</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<li>generate report</li>
<li>send emails</li>
<li>update time offset</li>
</ol>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Step 6 is executed by running the program <i>reader</i>.<br/>
It takes as input the supervisor configuration file, the database, the 
timestamp (in minutes) of the last iteration (one day ago) and the files
copied from the board.<br/>
The database (sqlite3) is composed of two tables as detailed in Figure 4
and it contains all information available in the files provided by the 
board.<br/>
<figure>
  <img src="db.png" alt="database scheme"  width="300"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 4 - Database scheme</figcaption>
</figure>
The only different is the time value as it is a timestamp (in minutes)
and not a relative value.<br/>
It is computed by adding to the read offset the read index times the
interval duration.<br/>
This application is also in charge of uploading data to the cloud.
</p>

<p>
The program <i>shower</i> generates the daily report to be sent by
email.<br/>
The inputs are the database file, the timestamp of last update and the 
list of emails.<br/>
The generated output is a gnuplot script that, when executed,
generates the temperature/humidity/moisture graphs of the last day.</br>
Then, the plots are collected in a single pdf file.<br/>
In addition, a file with the email body is generated, containing the
number of sensor failures and if there is any water tank to refill.<br/>
Then, the file containing the list of email is opened and, for each line,
<i>mutt</i> is invoked to send an email with the text body and the
report as attachment.
</p>

<p>
More generally, the software running on the PC is in the folder <i>pc</i>
and it contains the following tree:
<ul>
<li>./config.sh: script that lets users create the supervisor
configuration file</li>
<li>./update.sh: script that periodically queries the board to copy the
files with data, update the database, send data to the cloud and send
the daily report</li>
<li>./makefile: main makefile to compile the code</li>
<li>./src: folder containing the source files</li>
<li>./config</li>
<ul>
<li>cfg.txt: supervisor configuration file - do not edit manually but use
./config.sh</li>
<li>cloud.txt: file containing the API key to send data to the cloud</li>
<li>emails.txt: list of emails to send the daily report to</li>
<li>offset.txt: timestamp (in minutes) of the last report - do not edit
manually</li>
</ul>
<li>./bin: do not use the following binary files directly</li>
<ul>
<li>configuration: binary that generates the supervisor config file</li>
<li>reader: binary that sends data from the files on the board to the
database and cloud</li>
<li>shower: binary that generates the gnuplot script</li>
</ul>
<li>./data: folder containing temporary files - do not edit manually</li>
<li>./main.db: database file using sqlite3 - remove this file if you
want to restart data history</li>
</ul>
This software depends on the following additional software: gnuplot, mutt
and libcurl.
</p>

<h2>Watering units</h2>

<p>
The main task of the watering units is to wait supervisor commands and
then: reading from the sensors and watering the plants.
</p>

<p>
The structure of the watering unit is reported in Figure 7, while Figure
8 shows circuit. The list of component is the following:
<ul>
<li>main board</li>
<ul>
<li>mbed NXP LPC1768 - ARM Cortex M-3 MCU</li>
<li>powered by the wireless power receiver</li>
</ul>
<li>sensors</li>
<ul>
<li>humidity and temperature: HDT11 on digital pin 17</li>
<ul>
<li>humidity is in [0.0, 1.0] representing [0, 100]% humidity
level</li>
<li>temperature is in Celcius degree</li>
</ul>
<li>moisture sensor: analog input from pin 18 (value in [0.0, 1.0]
representing [0, 100]%)</li>
<li>water-level sensor: digital input on pin14 (0: normal level,
    1: low level)</li>
</ul>
<li>actuator</li>
<ul>
<li>pump: brushless DC motor - 240 liters per hour</li>
<li>controlled by digital out pin 25, connected to SRD-05VCD relay</li>
<li>powered by a power converted (230V to 12V)</li>
</ul>
<li>transceiver</li>
<ul>
<li>Xbee 802.15.4 using ssWi protocol</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When the unit is waken up, the systems run the following three threads:
<ul>
<li>main thread (normal priority)</li>
<ol>
<li>wait 10 seconds to have a stable power signal</li>
<li>read the network address from file</li>
<li>configure the communication transceiver and network</li>
<li>create and run the sensing and watering (aperiodic) threads</li>
<li>if shutdown command is received:</li>
<ul>
<li>terminate all threads</li>
<li>clean communication ports</li>
<li>wait until power off</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<li>Sensing thread (high priority)</li>
<ol>
<li>wait the start command</li>
<li>wait 2 seconds to stabilize inputs</li>
<li>read from the sensors every 2.5 seconds for 10 times</li>
<ul>
<li>if this lasts more than 60 seconds, send SAMPLING_OUT and exit</li>
</ul>
<li>compute the average for each input</li>
<li>wait the stop command</li>
<li>send average values</li>
<li>if any error occurred, send SAMPLING_KO, SAMPLING_OK
    otherwise</li>
</ol>
<li>watering thread (highest priority)</li>
<ol>
<li>close pump</li>
<li>wait until the supervisor send the watering command to the unit</li>
<li>read the watering interval (in seconds) VAR_TOTAL_SECONDS</li>
<li>clear local variable VAR_ACTUAL_SECONDS</li>
<li>iterate while VAR_ACTUAL_SECONDS is less than VAR_TOTAL_SECONDS</li>
<ol>
<li>read the water-level sensor</li>
<li>if the level is lower than the security threshold</li>
<ul>
<li>close pump</li>
<li>send WATERING_LOW</li>
<li>exit</li>
</ul>
<li>set <i>t</i> as VAR_TOTAL_SECONDS minus VAR_ACTUAL_SECONDS</li>
<li>if <i>t</i> is greater than 1, assign 1 to <i>t</i></li>
<li>open pump</li>
<li>wait for <i>t</i></li>
<li>add <i>t</i> to VAR_ACTUAL_SECONDS</li>
</ol>
<li>close pump</li>
<li>send WATERING_OK</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ul>

<p>
The configuration file is <i>cfg.txt</i> and it contains an integer 
representing the node address in the network.
</p>

<p>
The code is available in the <i>watering unit</i> folder and it depends
on mbed drivers, mbed RTOS, ssWi and DHT11 driver.
</p>

<p>
The measured power consumption of a watering unit is in the range [130, 190]mA.
</p>

<p>
The deployed system is shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10.

</p>

<h2>Cloud</h2>

<p>
The chosen cloud service is ThingSpeaks as it is powerful and for
free.<br/>
The channel <i>IoT_watering</i> is created to contains the following
fields:
<ol>
<li>node</li>
<li>humidity</li>
<li>temperature</li>
<li>moisture</li>
<li>valid</li>
</ol>
The fields contain the same information stored in the data files copied
from the supervisor board and read by the watering units.
</p>

<p>
Three scripts contained in the <i>cloud</i> folder are provided to plot
the temperature, humidity and moisture of the last seven days.</br>
Note that, in order to generate a meaningful graph, invalid samples are
stored but discarded from the plotting.
</p>

<h2>Communication protocol</h2>

<p>
The chosen communication protocol is
<a href="https://developer.mbed.org/users/mariob/code/ssWi/">ssWi</a>
(Figure 11). It only depends on the library MODSERIAL.<br/>
The concept of Port is introduced as a virtual memory area shared among 
all the nodes of the wireless network: each node can subscribe to a port
by creating a socket which exploits broadcast messages to synchronize
the port value.<br/>
Ports are (signed) 4-byte integers and are bi-directional.
Note that the read and write operations have a different buffer: if a
node writes on a port, only other nodes can read it - a node cannot read
from a port what it has written.<br/>
Ports are identified by a numeric identifier between 0 and 255.<br/>
Further explanations are out of the scope of this report.
<figure>
  <img src="ssWi.png" alt="ssWi protocol"  width="400"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 11 - ssWi protocol</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
The supervisor has a COMMAND port to write commands that are read from
all other watering units. This port has address equal to 0.<br/>
Each watering unit has 5 ports:
<ol>
<li>feedback: the watering unit writes the status of the last
    operation (e.g.: low-water level WATERING_LOW, error while sampling
    SAMPLING_KO)</li>
<li>temperature: the watering unit writes the sampled temperature</li>
<li>humidity: the watering unit writes the sampled humidity</li>
<li>moisture:the watering unit writes the sampled moisture level</li>
<li>water: the watering unit reads the seconds to water</li>
</ol>
The addresses of this ports are computed as the board network identifier
times 5 plus the port entry number.<br/>
The values sent through the humidity, temperature and moisture ports are
multiplied by 10 (as the stored value is an integer).
</p>

<p>
The possible commands on the COMMAND port sent from the supervisor are:
<ul>
<li>0x0000: no value - default state</li>
<li>0xAAAA: start sampling - START_SAMPLING</li>
<li>0x1111: stop sampling - STOP_SAMPLING</li>
<li>0xFF00 + <i>id</i>: start watering for watering unit with network
identifier equal to <i>id</i></li>
<li>0x00FF: shutdown</li>
</ul>
The values sent from the watering units to the supervisor on the
feedback port are:
<ul>
<li>0xBBBB: correct sampling - SAMPLING_OK</li>
<li>0x2222: sampling not correct - SAMPLING_KO</li>
<li>0x5555: timeout while sampling - SAMPLING_OUT</li>
<li>0x3333: correct watering - WATERING_OK</li>
<li>0xCCCC: watering not correct - WATERING_KO</li>
<li>0x7777: low-level water tank - WATERING_LOW</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>User interface</h2>

<p>
Users can check that a communication between the supervisor and watering
units is in progress by looking at the fourth led on the supervisor 
board.
</p>

<p>
A script is provide to generate and copy the configuration file for the
supervisor board.
To run the script, users must type:<br/>
<code>
$ ./config.sh /media/MBED<br/>
</code>
The script will ask information about how long an interval lasts, the
number of watering units and their characteristics.<br/>
Then, the file is copied automatically in the config directory and on
the board once it is not busy.<br/>
The first argument is the folder where the memory of the board is mounted
on the PC.
</p>

<p>
In <i>./config/cloud.txt</i>, users specifies to API key to be used while
updating data on the cloud.<br>
The file format is simple as the key is the first non-empty line that
does not start with #.
</p>

<p>
In <i>./config/emails.txt</i>, users can specify the list of email
addresses to notify periodically the state of the system.<br/>
To modifiy the file, edit it manually by appending the email addresses
without spaces or empty lines. For example:<br/>
<code>
$ cat ./config/emails.txt<br/>
person1@gmail.com<br/>
person2@gmail.com<br/>
person3@gmail.com
</code>
</p>

<p>
The generated email contains the following text as message:
<pre>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Update watering system

Last update : 18/02/2017 00:20:00
Current time: 18/02/2017 00:21:00

   0        4       12    33.33%

Low-water report
Watering unit 0: OK
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
</pre>
The text explains when the report was generated the last time and the
actual time.<br/>
Moreover, the message reports the total number of sampling errors (since
the last email) and if any water tank is empty.<br/>
The attachment contains three plots of the temperature, humidity and 
moisture (see Figure 12).<br>
<figure>
  <img src="report.png" alt="Attached pdf report"  width="300"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 12 - Attached PDF report</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
Emails are sent using <i>mutt</i> whose configuration is in
<i>~/.muttrc</i> and it looks like:<br/>
<code>
set from = "username@gmail.com"<br/>
set realname = "IoT Watering"<br/>
set postponed ="+[Gmail]/Drafts"<br/>
set header_cache =~/.mutt/cache/headers<br/>
set message_cachedir =~/.mutt/cache/bodies<br/>
set smtp_url = "smtp://username@smtp.gmail.com:587/"<br/>
set smtp_pass = "hoyrlibtdzptpxnh"<br/>
set imap_keepalive = 900<br/>
</code>
Note that, in case you are using gmail, you should activate the access
from non-protected applications.
</p>

<p>
On the cloud, the following graphs are generated, reporting the
sensed temperature, humidity and moisture level for each watering
unit in the last seven days.<br/>
Some examples are reported in Figure 13, Figure 14 and Figure 15.
The moisture level increases as the unit has watered the flower.

</p>

<p>
Concerning the watering units, the configuration file is created manually
and it contains only an integer representing the unit network identifier.
